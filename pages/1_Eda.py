At the same time, the higher **likelihood of cancellation** might also be linked to a **lower proportion** of customers making frequent service calls, meaning that while dissatisfied customers tend to call more, the overall number of such customers remains relatively small.

This suggests that monthly charges account for other telecom features beyond data usage, such as call or SMS plans.\n On the other hand, for customers **with a data plan**, data usage increases as monthly charges rise, implying that higher monthly charges may correspond to more extensive data plans.

SMOTE enhances the dataset by selecting a minority class instance, identifying its k-nearest neighbors, and creating synthetic points along the line connecting them. This approach helps improve model performance by preventing bias toward the majority class. We choose **oversampling** over undersampling because the minority class **contains too few data points** for effective training. Undersampling would remove valuable information from the majority class, potentially leading to loss of critical patterns and suboptimal model performance. By using SMOTE, we maintain the datasetâ€™s diversity while ensuring balanced class representation.")

Additionally, the correlation of the dataset is the same as a result from **SMOTE** which generated a data based on k-nearest neighbors.")
